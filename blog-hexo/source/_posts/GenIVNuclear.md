I want to help the world have access to clean, abundant energy sources.  Solar is great for many situations. My roof is covered with solar panels which produce enough electricity for all of my family's needs.

When it comes to large-scale power generation needed by communities everywhere, nuclear is the best. However, nuclear got off to a rough start. That was a long time ago, and modern methods of producing nuclear power are fantastic. What I am talking about is not your grandmother's nuclear.

More to come...
