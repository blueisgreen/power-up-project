Simply put, Generation IV (Gen IV) nuclear is about the goals for the next generation of clean, safe, sustainable nuclear power production.

* **Clean air.** Nuclear power does not release greenhouse gases.
* **Long-term availability.** Fissile material is abundant. We have enough for thousands of years.
* **Minimize waste.** New technology will burn what we consider today to be nuclear waste. Instead of sitting in storage for thousands of years while it cools off. The waste can be consumed more completely.
* **Clear costs.** The life-cycle of a nuclear plant can make it easy to predict its costs, which is attractive to governments and investors.
* **Low risk of meltdown.** New designs make the chances of a meltdown very low.
* **Eliminate disasters.** When something does go wrong, new designs allow a plant to shut itself down. It needs to be walk-away safe even in the worst scenarios.
* **Prevents use in weapons.** Some nuclear reactions produce plutonium which can be use in weapons. Gen IV nuclear actually can consume weapons-grade material, turning it into safer by-products. Instead of bombs, we get electricity.

To accomplish these goals, six different types of reactor are in various stages of research and development.

* Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR)
* Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR)
* Molten Salt Reactor (MSR)
* Supercritical Water-cooled Reactor (SCWR)
* Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR)
* Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR)
