Stating intentions clearly is empowering. These are my intentions for this website and the Power Up project.

* To teach anyone who is curious about nuclear power.
* To showcase the best and latest thinking in nuclear technology.
* To introduce the world to the ideals of Generation IV nuclear power.
* To provide an honest, science-based view of everything related to nuclear power generation.
* To help others get inspired to study and contribute to the advancement of nuclear power.
* To show how to think clearly.
* To be open to new ideas.
* To debunk lingering, crippling myths about nuclear power.
* To take the high road at all times, especially with disagreements.
