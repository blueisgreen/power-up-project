Radiation gets a bad reputation because it's one of those things that can kill you. What we tend to overlook is that it's also an essential part of life. For example, without radiation from the sun, the surface of Earth would be frozen and lifeless. No multi-celled organisms would be around to appreciate it, include you and me.

A more useful framing is that radiation can be beneficial or problematic. The right amount of radiation depends on the situation. Too much sun in one go leads to a painful sunburn, and too much exposure over time leads to skin cancer. On the other hand, getting no sun can lead to depression and vitamin D deficiency. These traits are unhealthy. Getting a little sunshine feels nice, and stimulates our skin to produce vitamin D. We call this healthy.

The Goldilocks amount of rays from the sun is not too little, not too much. It's just right.

Take a different case of ingestible radiation. Why would anyone willingly swollow radioactive substances? The usual reason is for medical treatments. Radioactive isotopes help with imagery of internal organs. Also, some cancer treatments rely on radiation to kill cancer cells. Under the right conditions (like being in the care of doctors in a hospital), a dose of radioactive iodine can wipe out thyroid cancer. If the dose is too big, it is likely to have unfortunate side effects. If it is too small, some cancer cells will survive the treatment, which means that nightmare continues. Goldilocks would want to get the amount of radiation just right.

I have heard that a dose of polonium, which is radioactive, is effective at eliminating political adversaries. We also do not want high levels of radiation in our drinking water, our food, or our surroundings. Some circumstances have no "just right" amount of radiation.

You might be surprised to learn that radiation occurs naturally everywhere, not just as rays from the sun. The ground is full of radioactive elements, like uranium and thorium. Stones like granite may contain uranium or thorium, which go through natural radioactive decay. Radioactive carbon-14 is in the air we breath and has been since the earth was formed. Life survives despite this radiation. In fact, gene mutations are caused by it. You might say that radiation creates variety, the spice of life.
