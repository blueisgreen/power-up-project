Why do I want to spend my time promoting nuclear power? Simply put, nuclear power offers the most sustainable means for human advancement. I also see that nuclear energy in general could use a boost in public relations. The topic is difficult to grasp, and anything "nuclear" has a bad reputation. By showing the bright side of nuclear energy, I hope to reshape opinions and boost nuclear power in the minds of the next generation of big thinkers.

I am doing it for the children. Yeah, that's right.

I am also doing it for myself. I like the mental challenge of understanding and explaining what goes on in a nuclear power plant. Nuclear power brings together much of the science and engineering that I studied in college and have never gotten to use. Plus, now that Gen IV nuclear is a thing, the world has a clear path to safe, sustainable energy that settles the whole climate change hysteria.

I am saving the world. Ooo, that feels good.

Misinformation bothers me. Nowadays there's a name for that: fake news. The misinformation about nuclear is not so much fake news as outdated reasons not to like it. Dinosaurs brought us fossil fuels. Don't be a dinosaur. People give examples of high-profile accidents as evidence that nuclear power is too dangerous, missing both the decades of successful power generation and current advances in technology that are being applied to new nuclear generators. I want to set the record straight.

I am helping people move on. Let's go.

On a practical note, nuclear power is pushing for advancements today that will unlock possibilities in the future. Humans crave advancement. Our most prominent high-tech fantasies involve nuclear technology. Most of the Marvel superheros are nuclear powered. How about any space-based science fiction adventure? Star Wars, Star Trek, The Expanse. Books and movies get to rely on magic. Yet reality is not so far behind. Jules Verne imagined submarines with a sustainable power core. Submarines today are nuclear powered. Various missions for getting humans to Mars are studying the idea of nuclear propulsion through space. Once on Mars, nuclear power is essential, given the lack of oxygen for combustion.

I am showing a path toward miracles.

Ultimately, it all boils down to one reason that motivates me to do this: I want to.
