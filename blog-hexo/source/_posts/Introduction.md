## Why should I read this?

You can learn all about Generation IV (Gen IV) nuclear power, the cleanest, safest nuclear power source for all of your electricity needs. This is not your grandmother's nuclear, so don't let her scare you. Instead, up your nuclear IQ by reading everything posted here.

Someday the majority of the world's energy production will come from nuclear power. We still need solar cells for clean transportable generation. We still need combusion until we find affordable ways to convert to electric motors. Natural gas may always be a great way to fry an egg. Over time though, large-scale electricity production for your electronics should switch almost entirely to nuclear power.

You will find many claims here. You will also find supporting evidence. Just keep reading, and you will learn everything to need to.
