Welcome to Power Up, an interactive magazine dedicated to informing the world about the positive uses of nuclear energy, especially for generating electricity. Nuclear power is a complex topic with oodles of interesting science and engineering behind it. We have a lot to cover, and we will try to make this fun.

Understanding what goes on in a nuclear power plant is a massive intellectual undertaking. Nuclear power involves many difficult topics that require a lot of explaining. Our intention is to cover each topic systematically and explain things at a level that an average high school student or graduate can grasp. As long as you are willing to think like a scientist or an engineer&mdash;with logic, rigor, and an open mind&mdash;you will get something out of this.

The word "nuclear" has bad reputation, and for good reason. Nuclear weapons and catastrophic accidents cause tremendous damage with lasting harmful impact, potentially in a matter of moments. The Power Up team is opposed to nuclear weapons.

As for accidents at nuclear power plants, the world has seen very few. All of these accidents have been studied thoroughly, and the means of avoiding them are baked into new standards for nuclear power plant designs, called Generation IV nuclear (a.k.a. Gen IV). This is the way forward.

Through education, improved designs, and careful training, the safe use of nuclear techology is absolutely attainable. Even nuclear waste is finding reuse as fuel in new reactor designs. The technology for nuclear power only gets better, and the world deserves to know about it. We can do this, and in the long run we probably have to, say to stem global warming, or before fossil fuels run out, or to explore the depths of space far from the sun.

Join us in learning about nuclear power.
